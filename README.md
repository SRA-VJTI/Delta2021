# Introduction
 
 - The **7th Delta International Smart & Green Manufacturing Contest** is themed "Seeking Smart IIoT Talents" and offered three tracks: "Innovative Machines", "Smart Factory", or "Better Future Living".
 - Our **Team DNS** took up the track of Smart Factory, for the **Smart Factory track**, we were expected to present realistic solutions or approaches with digitalization, IIoT, and big data management for optimized production processes, high-efficiency management & production, enhanced safety & reliability, quality improvement, energy savings, predictive diagnosis and maintenance, and green solutions.
 - The Contest is **hosted by** the Chinese Association of Automation **(CAA)** and sponsored by the Chinese Association of Automation, and the Industry and Information Industry Vocational Education Teaching Steering Committee **under the Ministry of Education**. It is an innovative technology competition for automation, smart manufacturing solutions and green technology applications organized by the **Delta Group**.

# Proposal
- Our Team DNS proposed the Pick Sort Place Bot
- So after researching on some trends and practices currently followed in the packaging industry, we noticed that there were shortcomings in case of:
  * Variable sized item packaging
  * Location based item packaging
  * Custom subscription box based packaging
- And we took to solving that with our [proposed idea](https://github.com/SRA-VJTI/Delta2021/blob/main/docs/proposal/delta2021090_PSP_Bot_Proposal.pdf)

# Design
- After experimenting and designing our structure, we emulated the material to be used by considering the following:
  * Material Strength
  * Stress, material and displacement analysis
  * Material Availability
